## Account Management

### Create an Account
1. Open the app ‚Üí **Sign up**.
2. Verify your email if prompted.
3. Set your display name and (optional) profile photo.

### Delete Your Account
- **In-app:** `Settings ‚Üí Account ‚Üí Delete Account` (if available).
- Or email support (see [Contact Support](#contact-support)) from your account email with subject: **Delete Account**.

> Deletion removes your profile and content from the service. Some operational logs may persist briefly for security, then purge.

### Change Email / Username / Photo
- **Settings ‚Üí Profile** to edit your details.
- Save to apply changes across sessions.

---

## Messaging & Encryption

- **Encryption in transit and at rest:** All messages use TLS over the network and encrypted storage on our servers.
- **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):** Where supported for **one-to-one** messages, only sender and recipient hold the keys.
- **Backups & multi-device:** If you export/backup keys (where available), store them securely; losing keys may prevent message recovery.

> If you suspect device compromise, immediately log out of other sessions and update your password.

## Duplicate-Image Detection & Blocking

To fight spam and harmful mass-reposts:

- On every image upload, we compute a **non-reversible perceptual hash** (an image ‚Äúfingerprint‚Äù).
- **Policy:** The **same image** may be uploaded **twice**. A **third** attempt is **blocked automatically**.
- We store **only** the fingerprint and minimal counters needed to enforce this rule.
- We **do not share** fingerprints with third parties.

### Common Questions
**Q:** _My third upload was blocked but I edited the image slightly._  
**A:** Minor edits often yield a similar fingerprint. Try materially changing the content (crop/overlay alone may not be enough). The system aims to catch near-identical resubmits.

**Q:** _Can Support ‚Äúwhitelist‚Äù my image?_  
**A:** We don‚Äôt disable global safeguards, but you can appeal if you believe the block is erroneous (see [Contact Support](#contact-support)). Include the image, timestamps, and the upload flow you used.

## Permissions (iOS)

We request permissions **only when needed**, and you can change them anytime in **Settings ‚Üí India Hybrid**:

- **Camera:** capture photos/videos to post or DM.
- **Photo Library / Add:** select and (optionally) save media.
- **Microphone:** record audio/video messages (if you use these features).
- **Notifications (optional):** message & activity alerts.
- **Contacts (optional):** friend discovery (opt-in only).

> If a feature isn‚Äôt working, confirm the permission is enabled for India Hybrid.
